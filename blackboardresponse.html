    <p id="p1">In the article, <strong>From Somaliland to Harvard by Nicholas Kristof</strong> Nicholas Kristof illustrates the life of a young boy blossoming into a smart intellect. The young
    boy Abdisamad Adan was born in Somaliland a small third world country that doesn't even have an United States Embassy. Abdisamad was a hardworking young man and was lucky enough to make it
    into the Ambaarso School of Technology and Science. Luck played a huge role in Abdisamad success but at the same time so did Adbisamad's tallent and hardwork. A huge part in his success was
    Jonathan Starr, who,<q>founded an English-language boarding school for the brightest boys and girls from across Somaliland. Called the Abaarso School of Science and Technology</q>. Without this
    creation Adbisamad would have never made it into harvard. Abdisamad grandma could not afford the a regular highschool but luckily Abdisamad was accepted into Abaarso. Overall I agree with
    the statement that,<q>Talent is universal, but opportunity is not.</q>. Abdisamad had a talent but his opportunity in his small third world country was very limited thats why he was
    very lucky to make it into the real world as a Harvard allumini all of his talent can go to good use now.</p>

    <p id="p2">A recent issue occuring for soccer players in the United States is talent and opportunity. Especially in my own community. High level soccer players with lots of skill are
    not making it to the next-level (college) because of there size or inability to play the United States soccer style. The US Soccer style is pretty much kick the ball down the field
    and try to outrun everyone. Its simply kickball. The US Soccer programs breed these types of players that like to play the kickball style but every once and awhile there is an odd player out
    a player that actually has immense technicall skills and ability. Sadly most of these players are not recongized for two reasons, They do not have an education to make it into the college level or
    simply they are no physical and dont comply with the US Soccer Style. Its sad to see that such tallented players will not make it into the next-level and maybe this is the reason that
    the United States has never won a World Cup.</p>

    <p id="p3">I choose the respond to passage 4 because I thought that the statement the author has provided is very meaningful. Its true too. People in third world countries might have talent
        but do not have any of the reasources and help to get to the places the really want to be. Abdisamad had some luck along the way but what about the young talented people that are not as
        lucky as Abdisamad. Especially women in third world countries. Some countries dont even allow women to go school which just means that they literally have no way to grow and use there
        tallent in the real world. Hopefully as time goes on more reasources will become available for everyone to shown the world there talent and special abilities.

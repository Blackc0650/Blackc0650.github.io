    <p id="p1">Holden Caulfield is concerned about the ducks because the ducks represent Holdens transition from adolescents to adulthood. Several times in <strong>The Catcher in the Rye
    </strong> by JD Salinger, Holden naively questions what happeneds to the ducks in winter. He questions <q>I was wondering where the ducks went when the lagoon got all icy. and frozen
    over. I wondered if some guy in a truck took them to a zoo or something. Or if they just flew away.</q>(7). Holden is in a transition, just like the ducks. He is changing from adolescent
    to adult. The ducks are transitioning from a summer pond with lots of resources, to a frozen winter lake that wont support there survival. Holdens concerns with the ducks is his way
    rationalize how thing change and what things, people or animals do when going from one stage to another. Holden is trying to make sense of the world, and that includes his place in it.</p>
